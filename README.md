Underhaul
========

Most overhaul mods add complexity, this one reduces it: an *UNDERHAUL*

This mod re-balances recipes, technologies and ratios for a faster and smoother play-through. It lessens the difficulty spikes of mid-game and end-game (but doesn't remove them!). If you like Factorio but you ain't got time for the grinding, this mod is for you!

This mod aims to cut the time of a play-through in half! Everyone completes Factorio (launches a Rocket) in a different amount of time. But as an example, if someone takes about 30 hours to launch a Rocket, with this mod that time will be shortened to about 15 hours.

Underhaul is for you if:
---------------------

- You like the regular Factorio experience but would like to complete a play-through in less time
- You like to speed-run. You find the challenge in going fast
- You are annoyed by some recipes having a long crafting time
- You are struggling to launch your first rocket because you became lost researching so many expensive technologies (that you might not even need)
- You want shorter games with worse graphics made by people who are paid more to work less

Underhaul is NOT for you if:
--------------------------

- You expect some of the difficult mechanics to be removed (like oil processing or biters). All difficulty spikes are preserved, they are just not as steep.
- You want a real Overhaul mod that adds mechanics and complexity

Balance philosophy:
-------------------

- Make ratios easier to remember
- Remove some technologies that are beginner traps
- Reduce the number of bonus technologies, but make each bonus technology more significant
- Reduce the feeling of grinding in the mid-game and end-game
- Keep most systems. Exploring the different systems of Factorio and their paradigms is fun. Maybe make them easier to use, but don't remove them

Mayor balance changes:
-----------------------

- Steel plates cost 3 iron plates instead of 5
- Red circuits cost 2 Green circuits + 2 Copper wires + 1 Plastic Bar, instead of 2 Green Circuits + 3 Copper wires + 2 Plastic Bar
- Science pack assembler ratio (for Red:Green:Gray:Blue:Purple:Yellow) is 5:5:5:6:6:6, instead of 5:6:5:12:7:7
- Copper wire assembler to Green circuit assembler ratio is 1:1, instead of 3:2
- Re-worked modules to grant more bonuses and less drawbacks. HOWEVER, beacons are removed (they can be enabled in the mod settings, but the recommendations is to keep them disabled)
- Removed technologies that most people don't use: Combat robot, Robot follow, Discharge defense (they can be enabled in the mod settings)

Other balance changes:
----------------------
- Reduced the cost for most wearable equipment
- Solar panels are slightly more powerful. Accumulators have greater capacity.
- Changed the ratio of solar panels to Accumulator to be exactly 4:1
- Made the cost of Nuclear Power (technologies and recipes) more viable for a fast play-through
- Reduced the  crafting time for a lot of end-game recipes
- Many small adjustments here and there to many recipes
